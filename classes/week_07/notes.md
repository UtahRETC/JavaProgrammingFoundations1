> The scope of a variable is that section of the program in which a variable can be accessed or referenced.

> In general, the scope of a variable begins with its declaration and extends to the end of the block in which it is declared.

> Attempting to overload a method based on the return type is a common error.

>Methods enable the programmer to organize various tasks into neat, manageable, independent bundles of code. (Java Programming: From the Ground Up, page 192)

>A method is a named sequence of instructions that are grouped together to perform a task. (Java Programming: From the Ground Up, page 222)
